# About

Base structure for my games, using **Heaps** framework (https://heaps.io) and **Haxe** language (https://haxe.org).

Basically a copy of https://github.com/deepnight/gameBase/tree/advancedBase with some readability changes on my part, and some added features as I continue to work on random game stuff.
